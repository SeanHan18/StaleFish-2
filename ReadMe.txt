You'll need two terminals opened from the root directory.
In one terminal, run "npm i", "npm run seed", and "npm start".
In a second terminal, run "npm run startFront" .

For testing admin accounts, you can use the pre-seeded accounts located in db/seed.js
(for example -  username: sean, password: seanpassword)
